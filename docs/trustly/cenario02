this is a cleaning robot wich is cleaning a rectangular grid of size nNx M, represented by array R
consisting of N strings. Rows are numbered from 0 tot N-1(from top to bottom) and columns are
numbered from 0 to M-1(from left to right).
The robots starts cleaning in the top-left corner, facing rightwards. It moves in a straight line for as
long as it can, in other words, while there is an unoccupied grid square ahead of it. When it cannot
move forward, it rotates 90 degrees clockkwise and tries to move forward again until it encounters
another obstacle, and so on. Dots in the array(".") represent empty squares and "X" s represent
occupied squares (ones the robot cannot move through). Each square that the robot occupied at
least once is considered clean. The robot moves indefinitely.

Write a function
class Solution { public int solution(String[] R); }
that given an array R consisting of N strings, each of length M representing the grid, returns the number of clean squares.

examples.
1. Given A = ["...X" ..","...XX","..X..." ], your function should return 6.

The robots start at (0,0), facing rightwards, and moves to (0,2), where it turns dues to the obstacle
at (0,3). Then it goes down from (0,2) to (1,2), where it changes direction again due to another
obstacle. Next it goes left from (1,2) to (1,0), where it turns once because of the grid boundary,
then it moves once and turns once more, wich makes it stand again at position(0,0) facing
rightwards, just as at the beginning, wich means it will now repeat the loop indefinitely. The total
number of cleaned squares is 6.

2. Given A = ["....X..", "X......", ".....X.", "......."], your function should return 15.

3. Given A = ["...X.", ".X..X", "X...X", "..X.."], your function should return 9.

4. Given A = ["."], your function should return 1, because there is only one square on the grid and it is cleaned in the first move.

Assume that:
	N and M are integers within the range [1..20];
	top-left cell is empty
	each string in R consist only of the following characters "." and / or "X".
